      <p> Moved to London from Houston, Texas in 2016 to attend University </p>
      <p>I am passionate about Education, Women in Tech, and International Politics.
        I have spent the last two years building my software engineering skills
        as I am working to combine my background in the social sciences with my knowledge and experience in the Technology Industry.
        I am fascinated by the stories driven by innovation, and hope to work in an environment that welcomes change, 
        and is dedicated to growing its social impact  </p>
